# ICGC Download Client
Universal download client for ICGC data residing in various environments. 

## Installing the Python Script

The python script can be installed by simply navigating to the icgc-download-client directory and running the command:

```shell
python setup.py install
```

## Using the Python Script

The required arguments for the python script are the repository that is being targeted for download.
Valid repositories are:

* `aws` _(Amazon Web Services)_
* `collab` _(Collabratory)_
* `ega` _(European Genome Association)_
* `gdc` _(Genomic data commons)_
* `cghub` _(Cancer genomic hub)_

Second you must specify either a file id using the tag `-f` or `--file`, a manifest file using the tags `-m` or `--manifest`
or both.  This will specify the file or files to be downloaded.  **The EGA repository does not currently support
downloads using a manifest file.**  It is possible to specify multiple file ID's using the `-f` flag when downloading from the
gdc or cghub repositories.  **The EGA and ICGC repositories do not support this functionality**

If not running the tool in a docker container, a user must also specify the `--output` where files are to be saved
and the `--config`, the location of the configuration file.  **Absolute paths are required for both arguments.**

## Using the Dockerfile


Start the dockerfile with the command:

```shell
alias icgc-download-client="docker run -it --rm -v {PATH}/icgc-download-client/mnt:/icgc/mnt icgc"
```
replacing `{PATH}` with the path to your mounted directory.  This directory must contain three subdirectories:
 * an empty`downloads` directory.
 * a `conf` directory containing the config.yaml file.
 * an empty logs directory`logs`.

This will enable the invoaction of the python script with the commad `icgc-download-client`.  When running through the docker container there is no
 need to use the `--output` or `--config` arguments.
